# Password-Generator

I modified starter code provided to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It has a responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.

Here is a live link to the website: https://ajdavis2424.github.io/Password-Generator-Repo/
